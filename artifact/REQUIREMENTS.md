The main requirement for this artifact is that the user has Docker installed on
their system and that the user has at least of 5 GB of free space available (4
GB for docker image and 1 GB for uncompressed raw results). We tested this
artifact on a machine with 47G ram and would recommend at least 25G. We provide
instructions on how to install docker along with instructions on how to procure
and run the artifact docker image in README.md.
